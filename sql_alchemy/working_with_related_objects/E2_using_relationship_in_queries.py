The presence of an ORM relationship() on a mapping is not used by Select.join() or Select.join_from()

This means, if we join from User to Address without an ON clause,
it works because of the ForeignKeyConstraint between the two mapped Table objects,
not because of the relationship() objects on the User and Address classes:
