#You might have wondered that you can dynamically add attributes to the classes,
#  we have defined so far, but that you can't do this with built-in classes
#  like 'int', or 'list'Å‚

# x = 42
# x.a = "not possible to do it"

#Using a dictionary for attribute storage is very convenient,
#  but it can mean a waste of space for objects,
# which have only a small amount of instance variables.
# The space consumption can become critical
# when creating large numbers of instances.
# Slots are a nice way to work around this space consumption problem.
# Instead of having a dynamic dict that allows adding attributes to objects dynamically,
# slots provide a static structure
# which prohibits additions after the creation of an instance.

#When we design a class,
#  we can use slots to prevent the dynamic creation of attributes.
# To define slots, you have to define a list with the name __slots__.
# The list has to contain all the attributes, you want to use.
# We demonstrate this in the following class,
# in which the slots list contains only the name for an attribute "val".

class S(object):

    __slots__ = ['val']

    def __init__(self, v):
        self.val = v


x = S(42)
print(x.val)

x.new = "not possible"


#We mentioned in the beginning that slots are preventing a waste of space
# with objects. Since Python 3.3 this advantage is not as impressive any more.
#  With Python 3.3 Key-Sharing Dictionaries are used for the storage of objects.
#  The attributes of the instances are capable of sharing part of their internal
#  storage between each other, i.e. the part which stores the keys and their corresponding hashes.
# This helps to reduce the memory consumption of programs,
#  which create many instances of non-builtin types
